<h3>Completeness for Boolean models formalised in Coq</h3>

<p>The formal proofs are inside <a href="/danko/boolean_completeness">this directory</a>. You can also browse the generated documentation as colored HTML code <a href="toc.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>In order to compile the sources, you need <a href="http://coq.inria.fr">the Coq proof assistant</a> <s>version 8.2</s>, a recent version (as of August 2025).</p>

<p>If you are on a Unix-like system, and the executable <tt>coqc</tt> is in your PATH variable, you can just run the command <tt>make</tt> from inside a terminal window. If <tt>coqc</tt> is not in your path, you can either set it, or open the Coq IDE and run Make from the Compile menu.</p>

<p>If you are on a Windows system, you do not have <tt>make</tt>, and <tt>coqc</tt> is not in your PATH, the simplest solution is to open Coq IDE and compile one by one file, making sure to do it in the following order: filters.v, classcomp.v.</p>

<p><i>Note:</i> <s>The formalisation is not complete, sorting of lists in lists.v remains to be finished.</s></p>

<p><i>Note (August 2025):</i> The formalisation is now complete, sorry for the delay. If you want to see the changes, you can use git on this zip file: <a href="/danko/boolean_completeness.zip">boolean_completeness.zip</a>.</p>
